1. Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
You can use '===' to test if two values are precisely equal. When you use '=='
type conversions can happen when comparing two values. A type conversion is happing
with 0 == false, because the result will be true.

2. Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often)
New local bindings are created for every call, so different calls will have different
local bindings so that other local bindings are not affected by this. A closures
is a function that references local bindings in an enclosing scope.

3. Explain what higher order functions are.
Higher order functions are function that operate on other function. They can
take other functions as an argument of return other functions (for example
the createTransform function from this week).

4. Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.
A querySelector finds matches for a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.
var example = document.querySelector(".example");
